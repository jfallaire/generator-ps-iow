This section contains information about the configuration of the Coveo cloud platform as of MONTH YYYY.

.. note:: Sources can be grayed out (we called them "Read-Only Sources") which means an advanced configuration was required on those and unfortunately they can't be edited through the Coveo Cloud Admin. If you need or want to change the configuration on any of them you'll have to contact our support team and this will probably be escalated to the Professional Services team to complete your demand.

.. hint:: Concerning Post-Conversion script, before modifying any custom script field in your Coveo orgs, I would recommend you to test your scripts first with this coveo-mock-conversion_ tool.
